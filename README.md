# ResponsivePort

## Purpose
Created a simple responsive web design that uses bootstrap to make sure everything renders on the page correctly on any size viewport. Purpose of this project was to develope a webpage that gives the user information about myself, links to a portfolio page (that will be added to when applicable) and also a contact form that can be used to get in touch with me. Contact page is still a work in progess and when I have the skills and knowledge I will make it so it directs all input to my email mailbox. 

## Work in Progress
This project will be continued to be worked on when new skills and knowledge are gathered. 

## Code Used
This is a fairly simple project using html/css/bootstrap and an outside source from fonts.google.com.
However more advanced codes will be added to make this project more advanced and easier for the user to view and interact with the page. 

## How to use
Fairly simple instructions, to access the secondary pages (portfolio and contact) the user simply has to use the navbar at the top of the page to cycle through the pages with a click on the self titled pages. 

## Mentions
Help along the way came from the teacher, TA, tutor and outside website resources.
